# ROot: SQL Injection Testing Tool
**ROot** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports both GET and POST requests, custom payloads, cookies for authenticated testing, and generates detailed JSON reports.

---

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests input parameters for SQLi vulnerabilities.
- **GET and POST Support**: Allows testing of forms and URLs.
- **Custom Payloads**: Load payloads from a file or use the built-in library.
- **Cookie Management**: Test authenticated endpoints using cookies.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a JSON report of detected vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-threading**: Tests multiple URLs and parameters simultaneously for improved efficiency.
- **Update Checker**: Notifies users of new versions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Python libraries: `requests`, `colorama`, `tqdm`, `bs4`

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r00thex/SQL-Injection-Testing-Tool.git
   cd SQL-Injection-Testing-Tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python ROot.py
   ```
## Usage

### Testing a Single URL

1. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python ROot.py
   ```

2. Choose option `1` to test a single URL.
3. Enter the URL, the parameter to test, and choose the method (GET or POST).
4. Use default payloads or load a custom payload file.
5. If needed, provide a cookie file for authenticated testing.

### Testing a File of URLs

1. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python ROot.py
   ```

2. Choose option `2` to test a file of URLs.
3. Enter the path to the file containing URLs, the parameter to test, and choose the method (GET or POST).
4. Use default payloads or load a custom payload file.
5. If needed, provide a cookie file for authenticated testing.

### Reports

Detected vulnerabilities are logged in `vulnerable_urls.txt`. A detailed report is generated in `report.json`.
